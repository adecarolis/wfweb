# CHANGELOG

- 20210406 	The repeater setup now disables elements for things your rig doesn't do.

    		We now query the repeater-related things on startup, such that the
    		repeater UI is populated correctly.

 	   	We now have kHz as the assumed input format if there isn't a dot in the
    		entry box. Enjoy that!

    		Minor change so that we track the selected tone to mode changes, keeping
    		the radio in sync with the UI.

    		Tone, Tone Squelch, and D(T)CS seem to work as expected. Mode can be
    		selected.


- 20210405	removed 150 Hz CTCSS / NATO as it can't make that by itself

    		added 77.0 Hz tone to CTCSS

    		We can now read the repeater access mode and update the UI. What remains
    		is to be able to set the mode.

    		Working read/write of Tone, TSQL, and DTCS tones/code. Some code is also
    		present now to change the mode being used (tone, tsql, DTCS, or some
    		combo of the two).


- 20210404	Tone, TSQL, and DTCS code added, but not complete.

    		better tone mode names

    		Started work on the tone mode interface.


- 20210401	Added placeholders for attenuator, preamp, and antenna selection UI
    		controls.

    		Moved some repeater-related things out from rig commander and into a
    		shared header.


- 20210331	Adjusting signals and slots for repeater duplex.

    		Basic duplex code copied from wfmain to the new repeatersetup window.


- 20210330	Added conditional to debug on serial data write size.


- 20210329	Fix crash when radio is shutdown while wfview is connected.


- 20210311      Add local volume control for UDP connections.

                add volume control to audiohandler

                Small fixes to UDP server

                Add USB audio handling to UDP server

                Changed frequency parameters to (mostly) unsigned 64-bit ints. This
                makes all the rounding code very simple and removes many annoying lines
                of code designed to handle errors induced by using doubles for the
                frequency.

- 20210310	audio resampling added / opus

		updates on virtual serial port 

		fixed input combo boxes from growing

		fixed 4:15 rollover/disconnect issue		

- 20210304	Tuning steps! Still need to zero out those lower digits while scrolling
    		if box is checked.

    		Fix spectrum peaks as well.

		Fix spectrum 'flattening' with strong signal

		Add separate mutex for udp/buffers.

		supported rigs IC705, IC7300 (over USB, no sound), IC7610, IC785x

- 20210227	changed the way udp audio traffic is handled
                on both the TX and RX side.

- 20210226	Fixed minor bug where flock did not stop double-clicking on the
    		spectrum.

                S-meter ballistics:
                Turned up the speed. Once you see fast meters, there's no going back.
		Tested at 5ms without any issues, comitting at 10ms for now. Note that
    		50ms in the first 'fixed' meter code is the same as 25ms now due to how
    		the command queue is structured. So 10ms is only a bit faster than
    		before.
                Fixed meter polling issue

- 20210224      fixed 785x lockup
                Added scale and dampening/averaging to s-meter

- 20210222      f-lock works now

- 20210221	added working s-meter
		added working power meter
		added visual studio 2019 solution (windows builds)
		changed packet handling, WIP
		rigtype stays in view on status bar
		added audio input gain slider

- 20210218
		added SQ slider
		added TX power slider
		added TX button
		added simplex/duplex/auto shifts
		added debug logging
		added TX and RX codec selections
		added RX audio buffer size slider
		started adding server setup
		
- 20210210	added control over LAN for rigs that support it
                has been tested on the 705, 7610, 785x, 9700.
		should work on 7700, 7800, other rigs.
		added different sampling rates for rx
		added different codecs
		added scope data for 7610, 785x.  
		several cosmetic changes in the UI
		fixed a slew of bugs
		builds on MAC-OS, Linux, Windows
		added ToFixed
		implemented connect/disconnect rig
		improved USB serial code
		fixed memory leak 
		redesigned rx audio path for better performance
		added round trip time for network connected devices
		added detection code of rigtype
		automatic detection of CIV control address
		added logfile capability
		works on a raspberry pi (USB and ethernet)
