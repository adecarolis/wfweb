# CHANGELOG

- 20210227	changed the way udp audio traffic is handled
                on both the TX and RX side.

- 20210226	Fixed minor bug where flock did not stop double-clicking on the
    		spectrum.

                S-meter ballistics:
                Turned up the speed. Once you see fast meters, there's no going back.
		Tested at 5ms without any issues, comitting at 10ms for now. Note that
    		50ms in the first 'fixed' meter code is the same as 25ms now due to how
    		the command queue is structured. So 10ms is only a bit faster than
    		before.
                Fixed meter polling issue
