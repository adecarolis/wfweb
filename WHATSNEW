The following highlights are in this 1.x-release:

	New major change is the audio transport mechanism. Lower latencies.
    	About box updated to include Patreon site 
    	added 500 Hz step for VFO
    	Added clock and UTC toggle.
    	Added forced manual RTS setting
    	Add RIT function and other rigctl fixes
    	Adjusted window size for radios without spectrum. Thanks K5TUX.
    	Allow dynamic restarting of server
    	New Settings tab
    	Enable High DPI Scaling
    	More multi-radio support (mostly working!)
        Split LAN waterfall data for N1MM+ Spectrum Scope support: There is a combobox that allows you to select 
        split/combine (or default). Split only makes sense for LAN and Combine for USB.
 	added radio status display with meters for audio (speaker/mic)
        selector for audio: QT, PortAudio, RealTime audio 
+       version bumped to 1.4 -- rethinking of a new version schema that makes more sense
+       temporary squashed logs; may redo later
+       audio fixes at exit
+       introduction of peak decays at the scope
+       resizing of top and bottom scope/waterfall
+       various fixes on the spectrum display


Notes:

- We know about high CPU usage on RPi.
- try the audiostack you like the most/what works for you
