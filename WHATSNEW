The following highlights are in this 1.x-release:

	many changes/mods/updates/enhancements to rigctld
	rigctld box added in the UI
	build process changed: you  can add the install prefix (derSuessmann)
        added "do not ask again" for switching off rig and exiting wfview
        added opus as audio transport 
        dual meter support
        rigctl basic split support
        rigctl prevents switching off civ transceive
        added 25 kHz step
        as a temporary measure sending multiple TX/FREQ change commands to the rig
        when we use rigctld. 
        people should use "fake it" in wsjtx as the split code is not reliable.
        tidied up udp server function for better reliability
	added some IC736 stuff
        and that lowers the latency to maybe less than 50 ms
	added PBT and IF-shift
	several bugs fixed	
	RTS as PTT for several radios like the 706/718/736…
+	New major change is the audio transport mechanism. Lower latencies.
+    	About box updated to include Patreon site 
+    	added 500 Hz step for VFO
+    	Added clock and UTC toggle.
+    	Added forced manual RTS setting
+    	Add RIT function and other rigctl fixes
+    	Adjusted window size for radios without spectrum. Thanks K5TUX.
+    	Allow dynamic restarting of server
+    	New Settings tab
+    	Enable High DPI Scaling
+    	More multi-radio support (mostly working!)
+       Split LAN waterfall data for N1MM+ Spectrum Scope support: There is a combobox that allows you to select 
        split/combine (or default). Split only makes sense for LAN and Combine for USB.
+ 	portaudio removed
+	added radio status display with meters for audio (speaker/mic)


Notes:

- We know about high CPU usage on RPi.
- the audio stack has been rewritten multiple times to get the best out of it and have the lowest possible latencies.
  (At least three times)
