The following highlights are in this 1.x-release:

	many changes/mods/updates/enhancements to rigctld
	rigctld box added in the UI
	build process changed: you  can add the install prefix (derSuessmann)
        added "do not ask again" for switching off rig and exiting wfview
        added opus as audio transport 
        dual meter support
        rigctl basic split support
        rigctl prevents switching off civ transceive
        added 25 kHz step
        as a temporary measure sending multiple TX/FREQ change commands to the rig
        when we use rigctld. 
        people should use "fake it" in wsjtx as the split code is not reliable.
        tidied up udp server function for better reliability
	added some IC736 stuff
	added portaudio (you need t change wfview.pro to select 
        and that lowers the latency to maybe less than 50 ms
